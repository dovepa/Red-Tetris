## Technologies
- Angular for the front-end
- Express for the back-end

## Features
- Multiplayer networked game play
- Designed and implemented using Full Stack Javascript
- Graphical display using HTML
- Implements functional programming principles
- Asynchronous client-server communication

## Project objectives
Everyone knows the Tetris Game and everyone knows Javascript, it only remains to build a Tetris in Javascript. Yes, but ... Your Tetris will be multiplayer and online. It will allow you to disturb intergalactic parties during your long coding nights (There are still some WIFI issues on some planets). Your Tetris will use the latest technologies Javascript which are at the heart of a great intellectual, industrial, and financial battle between Facebook and Google whose challenge is to be the master of the world. 

The goal of this project was to develop a networked multiplayer version of the popular game of Tetris using Full Stack Javascript. The project aimed to:
- Introduce the language of Javascript
- Explore the abundance of its ecosystem
- Implement key principles, techniques and tools of Full Stack Javascript

By writing a networked version of Tetris, the project aimed to demonstrate a deep understanding of functional programming, asynchronous client-server communication, and the efficient use of Javascript in a GUI environment.

## Testing
Unit tests have been written to ensure the code is of high quality and ready for continuous delivery.

## Conclusion
This project was a challenging and rewarding experience, pushing the limits of what can be accomplished with Full Stack Javascript. The project provides a deeper understanding of the complexities and potential of
